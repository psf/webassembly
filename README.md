# Python on WebAssembly

This repo exists to track the progress of Python on WebAssembly (WASM),
as a central location to pull in meeting notes, reference links, project
updates and some light project management.

We're tracking meetings in the `meetings` subdirectory and order them by year
given that this will likely be a multi-year effort.
