    * [PySheets](https://pysheets.app/)
* Using Web Assembly to Teach Code Generation in an Undergraduate Compiler Design Course (Ariel Ortiz) - With the Arpeggio and wasmtime Python packages it is possible to use a vertical slice approach in order to teach how to build incrementally a fully working compiler in just under 16 hrs. The language being compiled supports only one data type (32 bit integer), arithmetic, relational, and logic operators, variables, and also conditional and loop statements. The target language is the WebAssembly text format.
